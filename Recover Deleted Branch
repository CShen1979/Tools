## When you delete your branch , both local and remote, they are actually still in your desktop

git reflog

# check the commit details in the list
# i.e.: 
# a1b2c3d4 HEAD@{27}: commit: <last commit message>

# now either checkout revision or HEAD
git checkout a1b2c3d4 
# Or
git checkout HEAD@{27}

# maybe need to add -f . i.e. git checkout -f HEAD@{27}

# Create branch. This can be done in Pycharm or visual studio.
git branch recovered

# You may want to push that back to remote
git push origin recovered:recovered
